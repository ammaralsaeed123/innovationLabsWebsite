            In the Innovation Labs we truly believe that youth between the ages 10-24 are the future generation of leaders for Jordan.     The Innovation Labs provide this holistic education through its after-school programs, which emphasize access to knowledge through Information Communication and Technology (ICT), that contribute to create a better future, and to improve the quality of life in their communities.   The youth learn to imagine, think and create alongside mentors who previously  graduated from the Lab. These mentors provide guidance and regularly challenge them to go beyond what they think they are capable of.     Furthermore, we believe that all youth have the right to a healthy and secure education, as well as the right to express their feelings, opinions and ideas, which in turn allows them to develop. The Innovation Labs `intents to increase 21st Century readiness for members by enhancing their skills in critical thinking, collaboration, communication, problem solving, creativity and innovation with substantial emphasis on technology as an essential communication skill.

              Princess Basma Youth Resource Centre is a leading national resource centre for youth issues. The youth
              empowerment centre strives for young Jordanian voices to be heard while aiding their active participation
              in public life.
              The Centre also seeks to provide the opportunity, support, resources and freedom for youth to express
              their needs and shape new realities for their future while thinking creatively and critically about
              themselves and their roles in society.
              Many of the PBYRC programmes are designed for youth and by the youth. PBYRC works with young people aged
              10-24 from across the Kingdom.
              Its focus for this segment of society is particularly crucial to Jordan because nearly 60 per cent of the
              population is recorded to be less than 25 years of age.
